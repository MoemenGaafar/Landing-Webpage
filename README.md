## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Description

This landing page is a template for a dynamic website landing page. 
The main functionalities are the navigation bar dynamic construction, the smooth scroll to the selected section and the highlighting of the active sections.

The code requires intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Installation

To view the the landing page, open index.html using any browser (recommended: Chrome or Firefox).

## Runtime Environment

This code was running fine on Windows 10 Pro, version 1909 (64-bit). The Atom text editor was used to manipulate the .html, .css and .js files.
